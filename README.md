# English Wheel Design

This is a CAD design project I created during my **Épreuve Synthèse** in Technical Drawing at Marianopolis College. 
The goal was to design and create a tool or object of our choice. In my case, I chose an English wheel (a metal-shaping tool) and applied proper technical standards.

## 🧩 Parts Designed
The design was broken down into individual components required for its complete assembly.

- **Main Frame (C-Shaped)** – main support structure
- **Clamp/Mount Bracket** – Allows the tool to be fastened to a table
- **Top Anvil Holder** – Holds the main rolling wheel securely in place while allowing it to rotate smoothly and align axially
- **Lower Anvil Holder** – An adjustable mounting system for a lower die anvil
- **Upper Rolling Wheel** – Primary forming surface
- **Lower Anvil Die/Wheel and its mount** – Provides a specific radius for forming sheet metal into various contours
- **Crank Handle** - Allows manual adjustment of the lower anvil height by converting rotational force into vertical movement via a threaded rod with a handle.
