# English Wheel Design

This is a CAD design project I created during my **√âpreuve Synth√®se** in Technical Drawing at Marianopolis College. 
The goal was to design and create a tool or object of our choice. In my case, I chose an English wheel (a metal-shaping tool) and applied proper technical standards.

## üß© Parts Designed
The design was broken down into individual components required for its complete assembly.

- **Main Frame (C-Shaped)** ‚Äì main support structure
- **Clamp/Mount Bracket** ‚Äì Allows the tool to be fastened to a table
- **Top Anvil Holder** ‚Äì Holds the main rolling wheel securely in place while allowing it to rotate smoothly and align axially
- **Lower Anvil Holder** ‚Äì An adjustable mounting system for a lower die anvil
- **Upper Rolling Wheel** ‚Äì Primary forming surface
- **Lower Anvil Die/Wheel and its mount** ‚Äì Provides a specific radius for forming sheet metal into various contours
- **Crank Handle** - Allows manual adjustment of the lower anvil height by converting rotational force into vertical movement via a threaded rod with a handle.

## üôè Credits
- This project was completed as part of an evaluation for **Professor Robert Vincent**'s Technical Drawing course at **Marianopolis College**.
